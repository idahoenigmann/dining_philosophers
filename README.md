# Dining Philosophers

Python implementation for Modelling and Simulation project

### Implementations:
* thread based
* event based

### Features:

### Installation
Make sure you installed numpy and matplotlib packages.
If you are using venv or any other environment, I assume
you know what to do.
```shell
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

Then get the code and run it.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/idahoenigmann/dining_philosophers
cd dining_philosophers

You should see a visualization of the five philosophers meditating
and eating.
